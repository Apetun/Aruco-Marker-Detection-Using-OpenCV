# Aruco-Marker-Detection-Using-OpenCV
The objective of this task is to use the OpenCV library to write different functions whose aim is to detect the id, center coordinates and orientation of all given ArUco markers

- The Red Dot at the center represents the Center
- The four other dots(Green, Gray, Yellow, and Pink) represent the Corner points
- The number written in Red font is the the marker ID which is unique for a particular marker
- The number written in Green font is the angle in which the marker is oriented w.r.t. to the vertical axis. From the vertical, the angles will be measured as shown in Figure 2
